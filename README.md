# Manga-Book
Android app that uses [OpenLibrary API](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api) to search books.

## Overview

The app does the following:
1. Fetch the books from the [OpenLibrary Search API](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/search) in JSON format
2. Deserialize the JSON data for each of the books into `Book` objects
3. Build an array of `Book` objects and notify the adapter to display the new data. 
4. Define a view holder so the adapter can render each book model. 

## Libraries
 * [Android AsyncHTTPClient](http://loopj.com/android-async-http/) - For asynchronous network requests
 * [Picasso](http://square.github.io/picasso/) - For remote image loading
